## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Creating a frontend design can become long and redundant. I decide to create my own so that I don't have to continue to repeat the same process. While updating as I see new designs that catch my interest.

Here's why I created a template:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over from scratch
- You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

This design was inspired by [React Native Starter Kit Template](https://instamobile.io/app-templates/react-native-starter-kit-firebase/)

## Built With

This project was built using the [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) rather than using react-native client.
